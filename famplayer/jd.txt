dear jd, i hope this letter finds you well.
in some ways, you are a rubber ducky.  lets put that here


on the glass table.  in many ways, the pitch deck book, and the fact that you specifically just said spend only one day on it,
were the reasons for this.  i realized that as awesome bros go, you know we may have done all the things, and for whatever thats worth
thank you for reading this far.  at some point, or at the current point, you may want to know that certain words in this text document are
clickable.  its up to you how far you care to go.  and you know i spent alllll night in that KTV.  and the morning air and too bright to forget
the smell of the ocean and the car waiting for to take me home.  

the book itself fell out of rotation, and whether or not i'm putting it on
tomorrows stack or not, doesn't matter.  what matters is i have built it,
almost built.  and frankly, i could use your help.  and i think that whatever
comes up could change and empower many humans, if not all of us.  
and you can help it become, i know you can.   we've done it before with 
the chorus of the song, and although not necessarily 
always the more all stars, the better, more stars do do they win awards?
and its gonna take some time, and minimal money, 
multiply log a rhythm is something beautify.

and i know you can understand me
because i'm not writing it for them.  
you can handle the confusing moments,
survive, and make it better then
it was before, before the whatever
any system gotta return some values
