Any value (both objects and primitive values) may be used as either a key or a value.

$string, number, bigint, boolean, undefined, and symbol
In JavaScript, a primitive (primitive value, primitive data type) is 
data that is not an object and has no methods. There are 6 primitive data types:
. . . 
There also is null, which is seemingly primitive, but indeed is a special case for 
every Object: and any structured type is derived from null by the Prototype Chain.

Most of the time, a primitive value is represented directly
at the lowest level of the language implementation.

All primitives are immutable, i.e., they cannot be altered. 
It is important not to confuse a primitive itself with a variable
assigned a primitive value. The variable may be reassigned a new value,
but the existing value can not be changed in the ways that 
objects, arrays, and functions 
can be altered.

0-null: a whole bit of silence?
create a new string that spaces out userinputed string || style a user typing box 


I think there are a few proposals I have.
1. Dadeuce: the fern
2. Who they know (contact list with null or broken values)
3. bomb = 2x3( hp-1, 2 turn)
4. l/r + u/d (hp-1, 2 turn)
5. critical strike (hp-2, 1 turn)
6. flipcolor as function of "mode" (who.name/pic, where.grid, what.hands, where.wants)
7. hit? (y/n)
8. please read aloud: "         " (miccheck(?))
